## About the mod
This mod aims to the problem where SkyBlock mobs cannot be retextured by OptiFine because they're not renamed, only their armor stands.

## Usage
This is a Forge mod. Simply download one of it's versions' .jars from [Releases](https://github.com/Moulberry/SBCustomMobTex/releases) and put it in your mods folder.
You will also want a resource pack to be able to see the results of the mob. We recommend to [Download](https://github.com/Moulberry/SBCustomMobTex/raw/master/SkyMobs.zip) the one included in this repository.
